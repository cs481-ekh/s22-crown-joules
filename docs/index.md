## TODO - Project abstract
Science students struggle to understand and model energy effectively, and to relate those models to 
the graphs, laws and equations that characterize most physics instruction. This project seeks to 
develop an application in which students can develop, run, share, critique and modify dynamic models
of energy transfers and transformations in a range of scenarios. It builds on existing work by creating 
an app where students construct frame-by-frame animations of energy transfers and transformations. Programs that allow students to model and visualize energy physics do exist, but they do not allow constructing custom animations of energy transfer or a way for students to test their knowledge.

This repository contains a web application that allows students to design custom energy transfer scenarios by adding objects and energy to a system in the form of color-coded "energy cubes", then creating a frame by frame representation of energy transfer in a given scenario. This will allow students to test their knowledge of how energy is converted and transferred, and to visualize the law of conservation of energy.
