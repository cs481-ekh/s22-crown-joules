## Project abstract
Science students struggle to understand and model energy effectively, and to relate those models to 
the graphs, laws and equations that characterize most physics instruction. This project seeks to 
develop an application in which students can develop, run, share, critique and modify dynamic models
of energy transfers and transformations in a range of scenarios. It builds on existing work by creating 
an app where students construct frame-by-frame animations of energy transfers and transformations. 
Programs that allow students to model and visualize energy physics do exist, but they do not allow 
constructing custom animations of energy transfer or a way for students to test their knowledge.

##
This repository contains a web application that allows students to design custom energy transfer 
scenarios by adding objects and energy to a system in the form of color-coded "energy cubes", 
then creating a frame by frame representation of energy transfer in a given scenario. This will 
allow students to test their knowledge of how energy is converted and transferred, and 
to visualize the law of conservation of energy.

## Project Description

### What We Built
A physics learning tool that displays a visable exchange of energy from one object to another. 
The user can see as many "energy cubes" as they want transfer between objects and change energy types 
as they do. With one of the fundimental design decisions being that energy can never be be created 
nor destroyed, the user will not be able to add to or remove from the total amount of energy cubes 
in a scene after the scene is initialized. This teaches students that as objects go through physical 
actions, the energy they contain changes and is passed to other objects. After the scene is created 
and finished, the user has the ability to play an animation of the scene that they created. This 
program also contains the abilty to display a chart of the amount energy cubes per type over time.

### How it works
After loading up the application, the user will be presented with this screen:
